Machine Learning-
Day 1

Importing Library-

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# To open a csv file in jupyter notebook

dataset=pd.read_csv("file path")

# To extract some specific rows and coloums from it
 
x=dataset.iloc[r1:r2,c1:c2]

# Here r1,r2 are starting and ending index for the number
  of rows we want to extract.
  Same for c1,c2 for coloums.

# To show values of these specific rows and coloums
dataset.iloc[r1:r2,c1:c2].values	

# To fill the missing/nan values
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer
imputer=Imputer(missing_values="NaN",strategy="mean/median/most_frequent",axis=0/1)
imputer=imputer.fit(x[])
x[]=imputer.transform(x[])
x

// Important points in above code
1. Imputer contains mainly 3 argument
   i) missing_values
   ii) strategy --> mean,median,most_frequent
   iii) axis --> 0 for all coloums and 1 for all rows
2. missing_values must contain "NaN" N in capital
3. Then we have to fit it and then transform it.
